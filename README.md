## Framework of Solution

### Question 1： 

your first task is inferential. You are going to try to explain why a driver arrives in second place in a race between 1950 and 2010. Fit a model using features that make theoretical sense to describe F1 racing between 1950 and 2010. Clean the data, and transform it as necessary, including dealing with missing data. [Remember, this will almost necessarily be an overfit model where variables are selected because they make sense to explain F1 races between 1950 and 2010, and not based on algorithmic feature selection]


### Question 2： 

Now we move on to prediction. Fit a model using data from 1950:2010, and predict drivers that come in second place between 2011 and 2017. [Remember, this is a predictive model where variables are selected as the subset that is best at predicting the target variable and not for theoretical reasons. This means that your model should not overfit and most likely be different from the model in (1).]


 Used random forest and logistic regression for prediction and model validation. 


### Question 3： 
This task is inferential. You are going to try to explain why a constructor wins a season between 1950 and 2010. Fit a model using features that make theoretical sense to describe F1 racing between 1950 and 2010. Clean the data, and transform it as necessary, including dealing with missing data. [Remember, this will almost necessarily be an overfit model where variables are selected because they make sense to explain F1 races between 1950 and 2010, and not based on algorithmic feature selection]
